# consortium-model-multi-target-quantification

# Description
This repository contains data and analysis scripts for the manuscript ** A diversified consortium of engineered biosensors enables multi-target quantification in complex environments **, including consortium model pipeline (i.e. preprocessing, training, validation, and benchmarking). 

# Figures
Scripts used to generate each main figure and corresponding supplementary figures are organized into subfolders by figure number (fig2/, fig3/, etc.).

## Consortium Model 
`fig6&7` contains consortium model code: 
  - `train_preprocessing` and `val_preprocessing`
    - Raw output from high-throughput experiments and feature engineering
  - `train` and `val`
    - Final features used in regression and experimental conditions
  - `model.ipynb`
    - Model building 

# Supplementary Figures 
Scripts used to produce supplementary figures have been incorporated into the main figure scripts. Additional supplementary files can be found in `supp`.
